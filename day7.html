            <p>As this was our last day we had to drive back to Queen Charlotte, but on the way back we decided to go see some old unfinished Haiida canoes and then we went to see an old shipwreck. The nship used to be an old logging ship that ran argound in a storm off of Heckate Strait</p>

            <p>After our hike to the shiprweck we went back to Queen Chrlotte and went to a dinner prepared to us by one of the Haiida elders. This dinner consisted of traditional Haiida food and a haida blessing song to start us off. We had dried seaweed, dried salmon and bread to start us off, then we had cooked seaweed and seeweed with herring roe on it, then for the main course we had sweetpotatoes, rice with sea asparagus, regular potatoes, 2 different types of salmon, and come cod. for dessert we had some native berries on shortbread with whipped cream. It was the perfect ending to our time on Haiida Gwaii. After our dinner we went back to the ferry and made ourselves ready for the overnight ferry ride back to Prince Rupert. </p>
