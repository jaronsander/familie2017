    <p>After we woke up the next day and had breakfast (ingredients were already in the fridges) and then went to the Haiida Heritage centre. Unfortunately all of the installments were not completed yet and you were not allowed to take pictures inside the museum, but they did have some astounding totem poles positioned outside. Furthermore they even had a totem pole carver creating a pole just outside the museum as well as traditional sea kayaks which were also created in the museum. Unfortunately we were not allowed to take any pictures inside the museum but for more information click here:

    <p>After the museum we went to a nearby beach which was known by the lone boulder which seemed to be impossibly standing in the middle of a tide zone, to make things even better, someone had decided to put a rope swing on a nearby tree which we just had to try out.</p>

        <p>We then went back to Chateau Norm but after we made a stop at the convenience store where Barbara har decided to purchace some fish for us to grill for dinner on the barbeques provided by the chateau. When we got back to the chateau we all went our seperate ways but all ended up on the incredible beach at one point, this beach was full of old rusted chains, beautiful kelp and when you lifter up rocks you found dozens of small crabs hiding underneath. It was especially interesting to Matt who explained that there had been a large amount of tectonic movement in the area resulting in various layers of different typees of rock on the beach. Most importantly though, all the tectonic activity had resulted in a beach full of perfect skipping rocks. Then we ate the grilled(salmon) and went to bed early because we needed to catch another ferry the next morning.</p>
