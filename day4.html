            <p>Noam and I woke up relatively early, before breakfast, becuase we wanted to go sea kayaking. Matt helped us get the kayaks in the water and we cruised around the cove until breakfast. While we were out almost everyone else went on to the deck around the boat house and saw a deer, a river otter and a ratfish. All we saw was a sea cucumbers, sea stars, a couple crabs and a racoon. For breakfast we had amazing eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and fruit.</p>

            <p>Once we were done breakfast we packed everything together and started heading back. Our first twop was at a small aclove in a cliff, and because the tide was still coming in you could see all the marine life that had attached itself to the rocks. There were <a href="http://www.centralcoastbiodiversity.org/red-turban-bull-pomaulax-gibberosus.html" target="_blank">Red Turban snails</a>, often used by the haiida for decorative purposes, sea urchins and many other creatures. Oliver leaned over the side of a boat and grabbed a sea urchin and split it in half and cleaned it so that we could eat it, of course not everyone ate it, but it mainly tasted like sweet sea water.</p>

            <p>We then made our way to another Haiida village called Tanu. This took about another 45 minutes but when we were there we were greeted by a Mary, Walter and adopted daughter Raven who were the watchmen of this village.
            Mary took us on a tour of the village and explained what it was like for the Haiida less than a decade ago. When the missionaries came to Tanu they spread deseases like smallpox and this resulted in many deaths. The most horrific part of it was that the missionaries forced the Haiida to dig these mass graves for the dead so that they could bury them, even though it is against Haiida belief to bury the dead undergroud. So the haiida lined the graves with cedar to make it a bit more acceptable in their culture. We then went up to a small nearby waterfall and enjoyed the beauty of the landscape.</p>

            <p>We then continued on back to the base camp where we unpacked, took off our rain gear and departed back to the ferry. Once we had crossed bsck over to Graham islsnd we got in our van and headed to Masset, where we would stay the rest of the trip in a neat, off the grid, cabin that that had a beautiful beach just a quck walk away and a crib board. When we got there the sun was setting and it made for some beautiful pictures. After that we made our way to bed.</p>
