        We were all very excited for this day, because this was the dasy that we were going to go on a two day tour of the Gwaii Haanas Park Reserve with Moresby Explorers. We woke up early so we could catch the ferry to Moresby island. The ferry ride was absolutely stunning as we witnessed one of the most amazing sunrises.

        <p>Once we arrived on Moresby island, our tour guide Oliver picked us up and we drove, along with 4 other people, for about an hour over logging roads and through logged areas to Moresby Camp. It was very hard to take everything in, from the abandoned logging trucks, to the huge tree stumps left after an area was logged, to the deer that were half the size of the deer that we were used to seeing. </p>    
        <p>Once we arrived at Moresby camp, Oliver fueled the Hurricane Zodiac boat while we got on the raingear provided to us by the tour as well as some gum boots. Then Oliver packed our belongings in to the boat and we went to the boat launch site while Oliver prepared some more things. While we were at the launch site we (presumably) saw some Orca dorsal fins in the distance, as well as a bear. On the other hand we also saw how a team of three men dropped logs in to the ocean and corralled them so that a barge could pick them up later.</p>

    <div class="grid_12">
            <p>When we did finally depart, first we drove around a bit more slowly and oliver explained some of the history of the region. There was a lot of logging that had gone on on the islands, especially during the second world war. We saw an abandoned logging pier and headied to a beach for lunch. Before we had lunch Oliver took us in to the woods behind the beach and showed us the remnents of a old logging camp. It was super fascinating to see all the overgrown and rusty machinery along wilth old bottles and an unusual amount of old boots everywhere.</p>

    <div class="grid_12">
            <p>After our delicous lunch we geaded out on to open seas again, this time heading for an old Haiida camp. After about an hour of choppy water we arrived at Skedans. The remaining Haiida have established a sort of program where people of haiida descent watch over these old settlements and give tours to visitors who come visit these sites. There were three "Watchmen"as they are officially called at Skedans, but none of them were men, but three women in their early/mid twenties. Two of them were already giving a tour so we signed the viditor book and chatted with the other guide until they were done. Once the other group was mostly finished, Oliver started our tour. Most of the totem poles at Skedans had actually been sold to museums, but very few are actually on display so the Haiida are trying to get them back.</p>
            </div>
    <div class="grid_7">
            <p>Traditionally Haiida villages are comprised of various longhouses each of which belonged to a family, a family included grandparents, cousins, brothers, sisters, children and slaves. These longhouses were easy to take down and rebuild so that the Haiida could travel, but in their main village the family had a totempole so they could always find where their home is. behind their longhouses there were burial houses where they would keep the remains of their ancestors. The haiida religion is very supersticious, and it believes that all the spirits reside in the underworld, which for them is in the ground. The haiida never buried anyone in the ground becuase of this, and instead put the their deceased in bentwood boxes (boxes made of just one peice of wood that is bent in to a box) and then put them in the burioal hut, or if the deceased was a chief, their remains were put in a bentwood box and then put on top of a burial pole. A sign of wealth was also to have a fire pit, the bigger the fire pit the wealthier you were because the Haiida belived that A fire pit had to be built in one day, by the opposite clan, and if you wanted a fire pit you had to pay the opposite clan to build it for you. So the bigger the pit, the more people you could employ and the more wealth you had.</p>

            <p>After anna inlet we headed to "base camp" which is a floating cabin just outside the Gwaii Hanas reserve. There we met Carice, the cook, who had prepared an incredible meal for us which consisted of potato curry soup to warm up, mashed potatoes, kinoa beet salad, salmon and for dessert she made strawberry rhubarb pie and dairy free coconut mango strawberry sorbet. Fter dinner Oliver took Noam, Corbin and I for a ride in the zodiac and even let us drive it around. Once we were done with that we went in the cabin and relaxed a little bit, Noam taught me a game called crib, which would become an obsession for us on the reso of the trip because they had the cib board almost everywhere we went. After that we ended up going to bed.</p>
