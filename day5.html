            <p>This day was more of a setteling in day, we didn't really do anything exciting compared to the zodiak tour even though there was a fair bit of drama at the beginning of the day. We woke up, ate breakfast, walked around the beach a little bit, and in the process Noam, Corbin and I played a game of chicken, where the point was to see who could stand in one spot the longest while the tide came in. Unfortunately at the end we had stood there long enough for our feet to somewhat sink in to the ground so when noam wanted to get out og the water, his feet were somewhat unexpestedly stuck in the in the sand and he tripped and fell in the water, dropping his phone in the process. We stuvk the phone in to rice as quickly as we could but the phone never ended up working again. After that situation we headed out to Masset and in masset we made our way to a cafe which had wifi. Ater setting up camp there we looked around and looked for a grocery store and a liquor store. We had a couple cookies and Noam and I had sandwiches from the grocery store accross the street. After we had been in the cafe for a couple hours, we went to Home Hardware to get Corbin and myself a fishing liscence so that we could catch crabs in the beach just outside our cabin. Then we cnontinued on to a surf shop where we rented a skim board, our final stop for the night aside from our cabin. Once back at the cabin we played cards, made dinner and went for a walk on the beach. While walking on the beach we encountered a man that was digging for clams, and since clamming is something Mom wanted to do, she was quick to ask him some questions about how to dig up the clams properly. After out pleasent walk we headed back to the cabin and settled in for the night.</p>
