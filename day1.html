    We arrived in Haida Gwaii relatively late after a ferry ride from Price Rupert to Queen Charlotte, In total the ferry ride took 6 hours even though they said that it would be around 8, the weather was on our side that day.

        <p>Once we had arrived in Queen Charlotte, we drove off the ferry to go Chateau Norm. Compared to the seemingly endlessdriving we were used to, Chateau Norm was very close. After driving for 15 minutes we were at the cabins. We unpacked and somewhat relaxed, Grandma had her own room/cabin and the rest if us stayed in the main building. After unpacking we went to get some food, and per reccomendation we were directed to a small restaurant called OV Pizza wich primarily served pizza but alaso some seafood. It was fairly busy so we were put on a waiting list and were told to come back in 30 minutes. We used those 30 minutes to walk to the nearby pier to look at the various fising boats and the nearby fish procesing facility. When we went back to the resaurant we were given the menu and then were asked if we wanted anything to drink. Everyone who was allowed to drink shose stella at first because it was on tap, but the server quickly returned to inform us that they were all out of stella, the sama thing happened with the food, we ordered and then were informed that they no longer had any salmon. The food was really good in the end but the service was somewhat lacking and a bit frustrating. After dinner we made our way back to the Chateau and got ready for bed. </p>
