        <p> This is me, I am a 19 year old male who, whole writing this, is in a gap year but who is enrolled in the sciences program at the University of British Columbia for the 2017 fall and winter term. On this trip to <i>Haida Gwaii</i> I am in the wonderful company of my two younger brothers, Noam and Corbin, as well as my two parents, Matt and Babs, and my wonderful Grandma, Traute.</p>
