            This day started relatively early for us as Corbin and I got our crabbing equiptment, which was really just a net and a pair of waders, and mom and grandma went our and looked for clams. needless to say Corbin and I were a lot more successful than our female counterparts. As we brought home a lot more food. Once we brou ght all our crabs in, I killed them, shelled them and then we cooked them in sea water.

            <p>After hours of dealing with the crabs, the clams and playing crib, we were finaly sat down and ate them for a late lunch, and needless to say we were not able to eat all of the crab or the clams. We still had some time left in the day so Noam Corbin and I went back out to the beach and decided to try skimboarding. It was a bit difficult at first but we ended up getting the hang of it and after a couple hours we were really having fun.</p>
